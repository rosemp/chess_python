Queen - Can move vertically, horizontally, or diagonally/anti-diagonally

Bishop - Can only move diagonally

Pawn - Can only move up to two spaces vertically at start, but afterwards it can only move 1 space vertically. It can
also move diagonally for attacking.

King - Can move just one space in every direction. If the king is in check, it has to move out of it. When it finally
canâ€™t move out of check, the opposing player has officially put the king in checkmate, therefore winning the game.

Rook - Can move vertically or horizontally

Knight - The only piece that can jump over other pieces, having 8 move options that consist of the knight moving in an
L shape.
